Animal Behavior Tracking for Neurological Disorder Diagnosis
This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision-based system to track and analyze animal behaviors (zebrafish and rats) to aid in diagnosing neurological disorders.
The project leverages YOLOv8 for object detection, DeepSORT with a custom ResNet-50 for multi-object tracking, and K-Means clustering for trajectory analysis.The system processes video data, extracts behavioral patterns, and generates visualizations like heatmaps and trajectory plots.
